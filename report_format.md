# What should be included in the project report?

You can write your team project in your own style. Anyhow, good reports
should reflect your good understanding. Generally, each report includes:

a) The solved problem.
b) The used method.
c) Discussions on the simulation results.
Simple descriptions for a) and b) are fine if both the problems and methods are given in the lectures
or project.

It would be better to give more discussions in c) (the more the better).
Besides, if the team would like to do more (just optional, not required). They might try:

d) New problems proposed by the team members. If a new problem, please describe it in detail.
e) Modifications (or improvement) made to the methods. Please describe the modifications in details.
f) New simulations, and discussions on the new results.
