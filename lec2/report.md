# Neural Network for Even Parity Check

## a) Implementation Description

The implementation uses a three-layer feedforward neural network to solve the 4-bit even parity check problem. In this problem, the network must determine whether a 4-bit input contains an even or odd number of 1s. The output is 1 if the number of 1s is even, and 0 if odd.

### Network Architecture

- **Input Layer**: 5 neurons (4 for the input bits + 1 bias neuron with fixed -1 output)
- **Hidden Layer**: Varied between 4, 6, 8, and 10 neurons (including 1 bias neuron with fixed -1 output)
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron

### Learning Algorithm

The network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm with the following parameters:

- Learning rate (η): 0.5
- Activation function: Sigmoid with λ = 1.0
- Error threshold: 0.001

### Implementation Details

The program repeatedly presents all 16 possible 4-bit input patterns to the network and adjusts the weights after each pattern using the backpropagation algorithm. Training continues until the total error falls below the desired threshold (0.001).

## b) Experimental Results

The experiment was conducted with varying numbers of hidden neurons (4, 6, 8, and 10) to find the optimal network configuration for the parity check problem.

### Training Performance

| Hidden Neurons | Training Cycles | Final Error |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 4              | 155,058         | 0.001000    |
| 6              | 124,786         | 0.001000    |
| 8              | 25,924          | 0.001000    |
| 10             | 18,179          | 0.001000    |

The graph would show the error decreasing over training cycles for each configuration, with steeper declines as the number of hidden neurons increases.

### Test Accuracy

All configurations achieved high accuracy on the test set (the same 16 possible input patterns):

| Hidden Neurons | Accuracy | Notes                                   |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 4              | 100%     | Output values between 0.0106 and 0.9939 |
| 6              | 100%     | Output values between 0.0004 and 0.9960 |
| 8              | 100%     | Output values between 0.0030 and 0.9960 |
| 10             | 100%     | Output values between 0.0079 and 0.9922 |

## c) Discussion and Conclusion

### Key Observations

1. **Training Time vs. Hidden Neurons**:

   - As the number of hidden neurons increases, the number of training cycles required to reach the error threshold decreases significantly.
   - The network with 10 hidden neurons converged approximately 8.5 times faster than the one with 4 hidden neurons.

2. **Learning Behavior**:

   - All configurations show a similar pattern: a long plateau phase where error remains high, followed by a rapid decrease.
   - This suggests that the network needs to reach a critical configuration before it can effectively solve the parity problem.

3. **Hidden Layer Size**:

   - The parity problem is known to be a difficult problem for neural networks because it's not linearly separable.
   - Each additional hidden neuron provides more computational capacity, allowing the network to find a solution more quickly.

4. **Output Quality**:
   - The 6-neuron configuration produced the most well-separated outputs (closest to 0 and 1), making it slightly more robust for classification despite taking longer to train than the 8 and 10 neuron networks.

### Conclusion

The even parity check problem demonstrates the importance of choosing an appropriate network architecture. While all tested configurations eventually solved the problem, there's a clear trade-off between network complexity and training time.

The 8-hidden-neuron configuration appears to be the optimal choice for this problem, offering a good balance between training speed and network complexity. The 10-neuron network trained slightly faster but introduces unnecessary complexity that could lead to overfitting in other contexts.

This experiment confirms that the backpropagation algorithm can successfully solve non-linear problems like parity checking when provided with an adequate network architecture, but the choice of hidden layer size significantly impacts training efficiency.
